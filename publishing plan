Must:
* windows: have Qt runtime in download
* zip and installer on windows (check with rene)

Research:
* single file publish on Linux crashes (qmlnet problem)
* single file publish with all data included fails to load Qt UI (fixable?)

ideas:
* just zip for windows with qt runtime included?
* check how it works on macos
* figure out a working way on linux: maybe appimage to bundle a normal publication, framework independant but not single file?
    * or just a zip to start with
